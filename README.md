# RagingRecipes
A collection of Recipes for Programmers.

This project is to be a collaborative recipe collection for similarly minded programmers. Every programmer deserves to treat their bodies and fuel their minds with tasty treats. This repository should be a curated collection of recipes of the same. The benefit of this means of collecting and publishing is that we can upgrade our recipes overtime as we discover new and better approaches, branch recipes for alternative methods of prep(vegetarian/vegan/kosher/white|red meat/etc) and fork the entire repository to make your own.

As such this recipe collection is open source and freely available to all who visit Github, feel free to copy this work and enjoy it in your home. Pull requests will be validated in the kitchen before being approved. 

Happy Eating all!
